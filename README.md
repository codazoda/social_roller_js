# Social Roller JS

This is a simple Instagram bot written in JavaScript.

## Google Chrome Extension

This tool has been expanded and has become [Social Roller](http:socialroller.us). That extension makes the process really easy. That extension is also updated often so it prevents problems when Instagram changes their interface.

## JavaScript Version

This script requires a little work but it's free. Here are the steps to use the JavaScript version.
